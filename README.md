# Interval Censored Survival Models in Stan

This repository contains the Stan codes that I wrote for various Interval Censored Survival Models.

The data used are from an 1980 paper in the Organizational Behavior and Human Performance journal, written by Morrison and Schmittlein.

I use cmdstanR to interface with Stan. Users are welcome to use them.  

Please cite this repository if you do use any code.  Thank you.
