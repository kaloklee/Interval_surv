# Interval Censored Survival Models in Stan

This repository contains the Stan codes that I wrote for various Interval Censored Survival Models.

The data used are from an 1980 paper in the Organizational Behavior and Human Performance journal, written by Morrison and Schmittlein.

Interval censored models are not well-convered in the Stan manuel, despite its popularity in real-life applications.

Two Weibull models are considered for this exercise. 

The Stan code's generating quantities block consider parameter uncertainty and process uncertainy.  

I use cmdstanR to interface with Stan. Users are welcome to use them.  

Please cite this repository if you do use any code.  Thank you.
