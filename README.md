# Interval Censored Survival Models in Stan

This repository contains the Stan codes that I wrote for various Interval Censored Survival Models.

The data used are from an 1980 paper in the Organizational Behavior and Human Performance journal, written by Morrison and Schmittlein.

I use cmdstanR to interface with Stan. The Stan codes are separate and any user is welcome to use them.  

Please cite this repository if you do use any code.  Thank you.
